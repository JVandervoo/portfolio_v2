				Hey. I'm a Front End Developer. I enjoy making vivid, seamless interfaces. I've been working for a year
				now since I completed my BSC majoring in Computer Science in 2017. I've worked a lot with WordPress
				since then, making many fully responsive web sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time I like to drink too much coffee, eat really hot food and work out. I also go to weekly
				coding tutorials in order to expand my programming knowledge. On the off chance that you ride a
				unicycle, please do let me know.
